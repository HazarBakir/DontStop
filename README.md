# DON'T STOP
## About Game
In this first-person shooter game, you must survive in a room that filled with relentless monsters who are constantly chasing you. Your ultimate goal is simple: survive for as long as possible.

As the game progresses, the monsters become increasingly more powerful and numerous, and you must use your skills and quick reflexes to defeat them. Along the way, you can pick up various weapons and power-ups to help you in your fight for survival.

The game is set in a closed, claustrophobic environment with no way out, adding to the tension and sense of danger. And to make matters worse, there is a bomb implanted inside the player(you) that will detonate if you stop moving for too long, adding an additional layer of challenge and urgency.

Overall, this intense FPS game will keep players on the edge of their seats as they battle hordes of monsters and fight to stay alive in a world where danger lurks around every corner.
